I only quoted you due to all the Boko Haram adventures you outlined which I could also recalled.  I did not like this Buhari's administration. Infact, I dislike everything about his administration in the first 6 months of his first term as President. I actually supported Buhari in 2015 to oust out Jonathan, hoping for a beautiful change under Buhari administration, I lost interest after seeing his first 6 months performance. One thing that baffle me about we Nigerian is that we have a very short memory. Imagine during Jonathan's administration, when Crude Oil was around $150 per barrel due to the economic sanction on Iran, yet nothing to show for it. ",pos,0.8903

Was he now the same Jonathan people now preferred? Neither do I even like Buhari's administration a bit, since Snake children are the same, no kind one. If Jonathan had performed well during his tenure, there is no doubt, he would have won the second term even with wide margin. Even in his time, his Presidency replied everyone that criticized him, that's why I won't be surprised by 2023, when people will start shouting Tinubu, Sanwo Olu, APC  and forgetting 2020 EndSars incidence. It shows how Nigeria have tendency of forgetting past administrations saga. The only preffered situation in Jonathan's adminstration compared to Buhari is freedom of speech, and nothing more. I did not even expected that Buhari will be voted the second term, I actually thought we will bring in someone else. One thing we don't realize is that no administration deserve any second term. And guess what, after their first term, while they hope for the second term in election, and if they loose, its a very painful thing for them. See Jonathan as example, they always feel so sad and dissapointed. That's how we suppose to have realized that, any administration not peforming in the first term should be voted out.
