"While working in a blue chip company over a decade ago,   I dreamt and say our chairman seated in the office,   full of life. Whereas there was a lady whose face i did not see clearly,   drawing some fluids away from his body. the fluids were dropping in a brown calabash placed on the floor. I asked in that dream,   what's happening to my chairman and i heard a voice saying,   it's his body nutrients she was drawing.  The following morning,   i narrated what I saw to my colleague in the office who was also attending a renown Pentecostal church . He said well ,  he would have gone to meet him because of his closeness to him but he would not even take such a thing seriously. Moreover,   he was a free thinker  who believes if he does not harm anybody,   he expects nobody to harm him. Barely a year after,   this man was down with Leukemia and flown to the UK for Chemo. I did not know what this was as of then so I asked google...I read it was a cancer of the blood...his nutrient had gone. He was ok and preparing to come home for Christmas. They had renovated his home in ikoyi ahead of christmas. Suddenly,   he collapsed and died. His body was flown back home. He was such a nice man. I do not take my dreams lightly. Whatever i saw must come to pass ,   except I pray to avert it. Evil people abound.",neg,-0.7065

The University based unions are all entitled to the Earned Allowances. I doubt if there's anything Earned 'Academic' Allowance as far as the FGN 2009 Agreement is concerned with all the unions that signed the document. ,pos,0.4215
Other non teaching staff unions had conducted their negotiations with government after their 14 day warning strike before the covid 19 episode took over. They decided to reason with the government and had been engaging on several occasions before now. It is not as if ASUU had been slugging out alone. Theirs is just too pronounce because of downing the tools however the federal governmentthrough the Minister of Labour has categorically emphasized the fund is for all the university based unions to share. ,neg,-0.0772
"There are occasions that SSANU,   NASU,   and NAAT have fought the government in the past and it benefited everyone in the system. So all of them have been negotiating with government  using different approaches.",neg,-0.3182
You have some points there. But the money is 'earned'. They should present evidence that they have earned it rather come to the media to seek for public sympathy.,pos,0.3612
"One of the major component of earned allowance is 'excess workload allowance'. Everything concerning teaching in federal universities is governed by NUC regulations. An academic staff is expected to have a certain contact hour per week. A class is expected to have a certain number of students depending on the programme. An academic staff is also expected to mark a certain number of scripts per semester. We all know these regulations are not strictly adhered to by our universities. So,   an academic staff will naturally accumulate these allowances over a period of time.",pos,0.7096
"For non-teaching staff,   they are like mainstream civil service expect for academic technologists. They are employed to work 8am to 4pm. Most of the NUC regulations does not apply to them. And remember for every 3 academic staff there should be 1 non-teaching staff. I am sure you and I know that this is not what is obtainable in our universities. ",pos,0.5859
Based on above factors their earned allowances will generally be low compared to academic staff because of the parameters used in computing the allowances.,neg,-0.2732
The 20% being given to them is generous. They should provide empirical evidence with necessary data if they feel they are cheated not mare media propaganda.,pos,0.1877
You are right it is 'earned allowance'. So let them go and prove that they have 'earned' it rather than come to the media. It is not the public that shares the money.,pos,0.296
"Be like all this ones  craze,   when ASUU go 9months strike and ppl were abusing them of being selfish,   being cowards they did not fight. Now ASUU have managed to secure some funds they are coming out talking about sharing formula,   they better start their own strike to fight for their rights. Crazy cowards,   when they said nobody should join ippis they went ahead now they want to enjoy from what others fought for.",pos,0.7405
Each union negotiated earned allowance with FGN. That of ASUU members has 'academic' added to it.,neu,0.0
"While other unions negotiate earned allowance for their members ONLY,   all other unions gets something whenever ASUU negotiates earned allowance with government.",neu,0.0
They deserve something but certainly not above the traditional 20% being given to them.,pos,0.4767
If they have reservations they should prove that they deserve more than that.,neu,0.0

No. The general name is EARNED ALLOWANCE. That of ASUU members is EARNED ACADEMIC ALLOWANCE.,neg,-0.296
The 40bn offered by FGN is made up of computation for ALL unions in the universities based on 2018 forensic audit report.,neu,0.0
"So the issue is not about whether or not they should be given,   they are contesting the percentage allocated to them.",neu,0.0
They should provide evidence that they earned more.,neu,0.0
The agreements are separate. What ASUU negotiated is earned academic allowance.,pos,0.2732
No one is saying other unions will not benefit from the 40bn. But SSANU is contesting the 20% that is traditionally allocated to non-teaching staff.,neg,-0.569
This is not how to approach the issue. The allowance is 'earned' and SSANU should therefore present empirical evidence if they believed they deserved more than 20%.,neu,0.0

I am an academic staff of a federal university. Both FGN/ASUU and FGN/SSANU 2009 agreements have EARNED ALLOWANCE components. That of ASUU is EARNED ACADEMIC ALLOWANCE while that of SSANU is EARNED ALLOWANCE. Find time and read the two agreements.,pos,0.4939
FGN is common to the two agreements and therefore government generally calls it EARNED ALLOWANCE.,pos,0.2732

"The report puts the total earned allowance claim for the period of 2009 - 2016 for ALL unions at 160bn. Out of this amount government has paid 80bn as at 2019. The remaining 80bn was spread into 4 instalmental payments of 20bn each to be paid on 2019,   2020,   2021,   and 2022.",neu,0.0
The current 40bn is is made up of 2 instalmental payments for 2019 and 2020. Both tranches have claims of non-teaching staff incorporated.,neu,0.0

Truth is,   if one has proper education at O'level you are already equipped ti a great extent. University education should be made exclusive to exceptional students into top professional courses. The rest can go into commercial,   vocational or technical schools which should not be stupidly degraded as we have today. I see no reason for some courses in university like Vocational,   Education Faculty (when we have colleges of Education) and the likes. People should be confident to apply for decent jobs after SSCE and thOse eho opt to proceed to commercial,   vocational or technical schools should henceforth not be seen as less equipped.",pos,0.9818

Sadly,   only an insignificant minority of these lecturers are smart enough to handle courses. The rest are nonentities who have Phds (meal ticket) and therefore have a bloated sense of entitlement.
