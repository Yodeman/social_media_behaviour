After that, use your toothbrush or a special tongue brush to brush your tongue very well.  Rinse your mouth. Get hydrogen peroxide and mix it with equal part water(50/50 ratio mixture). Put the mixture in your mouth and swish around your mouth for one minute(do not do less). Spit it out. Then put another mixture in your mouth and gargle for 30-60seconds.

Like congealed dental plaque. They actually looked like the inner embryo of a seed of corn. Those terrible tonsils were also linked to loads of colds and chest infections. The rate at which I used to fall ill was very high - even people that didn't know me very well always knew I had colds. ",neg,-0.318

And they smell foul - if I broke one open, my siblings would run out of the room from the odor. They were the absolute cause of my bad breath. No matter how many times a day I brushed, flossed, used various strengths of mouthwash, my breath was always kicking and disturbing somebody. I don't know how my friends put up with me. One day my bf stopped kissing me to tell me my breath stunk! I'd just cleaned my mouth thoroughly!!! . The shame.",neg,-0.9293
My Primary Care doctor examined me on some occasions. He could see that the problems weren't self resolving or going away. He explained that since I was an adult I had no use for my tonsils. They were a vestigial organ with the main use to protect from infections in childhood. Since they were causing more problems it was better to remove them.  My primary Care doctor referred me to an ENT surgeon at a hospital who operated and removed both of my tonsils. It took about 2 weeks to recover in full following the operation and for the scabs to fall off from the wound site. Its been 8 years and I haven't had a single tonsil stone or serious instance of bad breath since. ,neg,-0.1739
This is just my personal insight & experience. I notice you'd mentioned touching your tonsil in one of the posts and the smell was bad. That is a very strong indication that all may not be well with your tonsils! I'd definitely get that checked out if I was @op right now. No amount of mouth washing will take care of this mechanical/functional failure on a permanent basis.,neg,-0.1563

"I wanted to talk about this briefly.  I've been a regular contributor for years on the HIV Prevention forum here at MH, so I see just how common HIV Anxiety is.  Some people may have had a scary situation, such as finding out an ex partner had become infected, and they can't seem to accept that they're okay. ",neg,-0.8118
"However, the majority of people we see had NO risk at all for contracting HIV, yet the fear still consumes them.  This can be a common phase, particularly for a young adult in their late teens, early 20's.  It is also far more common in countries where sexual activities are viewed as being ""bad"", and where religions dictate strict sexual behaviors of a certain sort.  We get a LOT of posters from the Middle Eastern countries. ",neg,-0.7297
"So, why do people develop such a strong and irrational fear of HIV?  For one, the stigma behind it.  The stigma surrounding  HIV has improved a lot since the emergence of the disease, but not completely.  Also, in those countries I mentioned above, HIV still has a very strong stigma attached to it, and it is still largely seen as a ""gay"" disease, which is shunned in many parts of the world.  Additionally, the education behind HIV is primarily delivered in a ""fear based"" fashion, for good reason.  Educators DO, to a point, try to ""scare"" children about HIV in hopes they will be very careful in the sexual arena.  This plants a seed in the heads of kids about HIV.  They are taught to fear it rather than learn about it.  MOST people have an extremely overinflated view of HIV, and the risks associated with it.  Most people would tell you you can get HIV from kissing, or sharing someone's toothbrush.  WRONG.  Or, from getting your nails done, or a tattoo.  WRONG again.  There's a simple fact that people with a fear of HIV MUST start getting into their head...HIV is HARD to get.  You'd have to work pretty hard, or take extreme risks to end up infected. ",neg,-0.8131
"Also, while there are FAR too many people infected, the overall numbers, in comparison to the total population, are small.  MOST people do NOT have HIV, even sex workers.  The ONLY way you COULD end up with HIV is if you have unprotected sex (vaginal OR anal) OR if you share IV drugs.  That's it.  People find that impossible to believe, but it's true. ",pos,0.3506
"Ok, so you've developed an abnormal fear of HIV.  You're fearful of public bathrooms, you don't like to shake hands with strangers, you have even imagined that someone poked you with a needle, or that you stepped on one. So, what do you do?  IF your fear is a result of a REAL HIV scare, then give it some time.  Usually the anxiety will start to resolve.  If it's not related to an actual HIV scare, or if you cannot believe your negative results, or if you're dreaming up all kinds of irrational scenarios of how you could have been exposed...it's time to get some professional help.  People knowledgeable about HIV can tell you ALL  day long that you weren't at risk, or don't have it, but your irrational mind won't let you believe it.  Just like any kind of anxiety disorder, or OCD,or depression, when fears become obsessive, or phobic in nature...seeking a mental health professional is the only logical choice.  Usually with a combination of meds and therapy, they will help you learn to break that anxious cycle of thinking and worrying.  It takes some time, and some work, but it can be done.  You don't have to live in fear, and HIV is NOT out to get you! ",neg,-0.9876

There was an exposure that same day before the test. We actually did the test in my house because I had the HIV strips. We repeated the tests in the hospital that day, and she turned out to still be positive while I was negative. I used protection during the exposure, but there were other risky activities, coupled with the fact I had a cut on my finger which may have contacted her fluid. Also when we did the test, the environment was very bloody because of the nasty pricks we pricked ourselves trying to get out blood for the test. I didn't wear a glove, and I could remember her trying to press my thumb to squeeze blood out of my thumb with probably her unclean hand because I took her blood first(how clumsy of me for not looking at the HIV test strip where I had placed her blood. If I had noticed her result was positive, I wouldn't have even allowed her to hold a pin to prick me when she didn't wash her hand). Well, after confirming her status at the hospital that same day, I received my PEP drugs the next day(as yours but, an Indian brand called Hetero; yours is Mylan from US I suppose). All through the 28 days, it wasn't easy. I had severe anxiety. Having plenty HIV test strips in my house didn't help either; I pricked my self countless number of times to release blood to check my status using the strips almost every 3 days. I finished my PEP after 28 days which was 2 weeks ago; a test that day came out negative. I did a test yesterday( 6 weeks after exposure) which also came out negative. But I know it is too premature to be jubilant. A test 3 months after the exposure (6 weeks from now) will give me a better reflection of my status. Meanwhile I had sore throats and running nose in the later half of my 28 days of my PEP. I even still have some mild sore throat, a feeling of internal heat up till now even though my temperature never goes above 37C, some goosebump-like rash on the centre of my chest, and persistent stooling. I developed these symptoms when I started the PEP drugs, and I felt they were side effects of the medication. It really worries me that I still have the symptoms 2 weeks after stopping the drugs. At this point, I have zeroed any optimism of remaining negative at the end of 3 months or 6 months after exposure. I'm tired of the anxiety. I will probably not do any more test until after 3 or even 6 months. What will be will be.",neg,-0.9854

"For the so-called illiterate experts that are out there- people who think they know it all because of an out-dated medical education, hydroxychloroquine CANNOT kill a virus. IT IS MEANT FOR THE PROTIST GROUP. A protist is a microscopic organism that can cause a disease when it invades the body. A notable example is Plasmodium- which is responsible for MALARIA. Plasmodium is a parasite. It is its biological byproduct that causes malaria. Unlike plasmodium, a virus is NOT AN ORGANISM. It is a strand of RNA or DNA wrapped in a protein shealth.",pos,0.7217
What does it mean?,neu,0.0
"It means that once a virus finds its way to your body. Its outer protein coat has spikes that are codes. If its code matches the cellular code, your cells are tricked into accepting it thinking it is one of them. Once the virus goes into your cells, it tries to use your cell's chromosomes to replicate exact copies of itself. It will keep doing this, until your cells cannot hold it anymore. So your cells lyse themselves due to pressure to release the virus- meaning they burst. A notable example is the mouth sores (Herpes Virus). This is why cold sores are very infectious. It happens all the time too for infected people!",neg,-0.5707
"Now, malaria drugs are ineffective against viruses. This is because viruses cannot be knocked out by anti-malarial drugs, so that the virus can be eaten by your own body soldiers (white blood cells like phagocytes, T-Cells and B-Cells and Macrophages). A virus is a genetic code that becomes active inside your body. So why exactly are you looking to knock out with Malaria drugs and zinc?? ",pos,0.6199
"The reason why anti-malaria works against Plasmodium is because they either numb them for the white blood cells to attack overwhelmingly, or they kill Plasmodium. Either way, Plasmodium will not be able to use its enzymes to get into cells in order to feed. Compare to Plasmodium, viruses are so small that Plasmodium will not even see them , if they lived in a world together! ",neg,-0.8999
"I am angry that they had this black doctor say these things, when everyone in second year medical school knows that there are ONLY TWO ways of killing viruses in the body. First, viruses are killed in the body through vaccines(an antigen containing weak viruses) injected into the body. When the white blood cells see them, they can attack them successfully. When the virus are eaten, the phagocytes will regurgitate pieces of the virus to the B-Cells and T-Cells. These cells store the bits of the virus, so they can learn to recognize the virus entry again. And, use the strategy the phagocytes used for successful viral elimination. If you do not believe me, ready any advanced medical microbiology textbook or GOOGLE. The second way of killing virus is to stop their cycles. Viruses have cycles. From cell entry to cell lysis. Once anti-viral medication messes up one of the cycles, a whole generation can be wiped off due their inability to continue the cycles. The second way does not always work, because some viruses can recode their protein shells to match the cells. So, your white bloods cannot see them in the blood stream because they blend as body cells and white blood cells only attack foreign antigens (except in extremely rare cases like cancer and others). Also, anti-viral medication cannot work because the viruses are so smaller than cells that they can hide in your cell nucleus. There is no way a drug can reach them or even white blood cells. White blood cells do not even go into cells to attack! They have to get the virus before it goes into the cells. Sometimes, a cell has to die early by bursting to send invasion signals to other cells who will create little gaps for white bloods to get in and attack whatever was released.",neg,-0.9894
"Besides this, anti-viral medications rarely attack the strong protein coat of viruses. That is why cold sores, hepatitis A B C , HPV, HIV and others do not have anti-viral cure. Rather Hepatitis and HPV have some sorta vaccines to introduce weak viruses that your body can take care of and store the memory of attack for next viral invasion.",pos,0.4031
"Anyways, enough of microbiology.",neu,0.0
"Now, it takes a fool to say corona virus is not real. It is as real as you. And, it has come to stay like HIV and others. Remember HIV killed millions during its early stages until it was regulated? Still no cure today. There are actually no viral cure. Only vaccines help boost our body soldiers- the white blood cells. That is why HIV first kills off your white blood cells, before cell entry. So, protect yourself. Wear masks. Just because a person is a doctor does not mean they have all the answers. Medical doctors ARE NOT research scientists. If scientists say to wash hands regularly, wear mask and stay six feet, just shut your trap and do it. Stop being selfish. Stop spreading fake news with no evidence.

Knowlege of the mechanism of action, pathophysiology of the disease, Anecdotal evidence and evidence in practice are usually all they need to prescribe such drugs so far as the benefit of use outweighs the risk.
